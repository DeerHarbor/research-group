  **Objective**

  Social isolation and loneliness have been associated with increased incidence of 

  cardiovascular disease (CVD), but few studies have evaluated the impact of social isolation 

  and loneliness on mortality in people with existing CVD, and these are limited to Western 

  populations. We examined whether social isolation and loneliness associated with increased 

  risk of mortality in individuals with established CVD in Taiwan.


  **Methods**

  The cohort was composed of 1,267 patients with confirmed CVD aged 65 years or 

  older followed up for up to 10 years. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to 

  examine the association between social isolation and loneliness at baseline and mortality at 

  follow-up by adjusting for demographic variables, health-related behaviors, and health status.


  **Results**

  There were 593 deaths over the follow-up period. Social isolation was associated 

  with increased risk of mortality after accounting for established risk factors (hazard ratio 

  [HR]=1.16; 95% CI=1.06, 1.26), while loneliness was not associated with increased risk of 

  mortality (HR=0.95; 95% CI=0.82, 1.09). When both social isolation and loneliness were 

  included in the model, social isolation maintained an association with mortality (HR=1.16; 95% CI=1.07, 1.27).


  **Conclusions**

  Social isolation is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients 

  with CVD, and the effects are independent of loneliness. These findings expand our 

  knowledge about the impact of social isolation on the outcomes of CVD in non-Western 

  countries. Efforts to reduce isolation may have substantial benefits in terms of mortality in 

  patients with CVD.
