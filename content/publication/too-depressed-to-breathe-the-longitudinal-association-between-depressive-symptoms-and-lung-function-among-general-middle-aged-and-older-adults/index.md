  Objective: Most previous studies focusing on the association between
  depressive symptoms and lung function were conducted in patients with chronic
  lung diseases. This study aims to investigate the association of depressive
  symptoms with lung function among general Chinese middle-aged and older
  adults.


  Participants: This study used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Analyses were conducted with data from three waves (2011, 2013, and 2015) and restricted to those respondents aged 45 and older. Finally, 9,487 individuals [mean age (SD)=58.47 (9.19); female, 53.1%] were included in analysis. 


  Methods: Depressive symptoms were measured by the Chinese version of 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10). Lung function was assessed by peak expiratory flow (PEF). Two-level linear mixed growth models were used to evaluate the longitudinal association between depressive symptoms and PEF. 


  Results: Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with PEF among general middle-aged and older adults (b=−1.85, p<0.001) after adjusting for multiple confounding factors. A significant interaction between depressive symptoms and gender was found (b=1.29, p<0.001). The association between depressive symptoms and PEF was greater for men (b=−2.36, p<0.001) than for women (b=−1.46, p<0.001).


  Conclusions: This longitudinal study found that increased depressive symptoms were associated with reduced PEF in middle-aged and older adults in China. Compared with women, men with a higher level of depressive symptoms experienced a greater decrement in PEF. Our findings suggest that it is possible to reduce the effects of PEF by improving psychological health among general middle-aged and older populations.
